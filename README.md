# SwiftSoftwareSystemModel

## Introduction

A reusable package for creating abstract models of software systems.  This system is written in Swift and primarily designed for helping understand the architecture of Swift programs.  However there is no reason it could not be used to analyze and diagram code in other languages.

For more specifics on how this package can be used please see also [SwiftCodeHelper](https://github.com/kevinvandenbreemen/SwiftCodeHelper).
